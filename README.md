# calculator

This is the final project in the "Fundamentals" section of the Odin Project. This program is a simple scientific calculator that has the ability to evaluate number with the following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. It also has the ability to evaluate floating point and negative numbers. This program was written using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The calculator design was done by me using CSS. This project taught me how to really track down and handle bugs, as well as how to come up with multiple solutions to problems. There were many times where the solution I thought would work ended up hitting a dead end. however, I continued to try more potential solutions, until one worked with all the correct specifications. Thank you, and I hope you enjoy!
